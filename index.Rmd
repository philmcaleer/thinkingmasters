# This blog

This document was last updated on `r Sys.Date()` and is a series of questions that a person might want to consider asking, or finding information about, when thinking about what Masters programme is right for them in the UK. 

**Please note:** if viewing this blog on a phone, use landscape orientation rather than portrait for better functionality.

## What is a Masters Programme in the UK?

A Masters programme is typically a one year course that is undertaken after you complete an undergraduate degree in a related subject. For example, if you have completed an undergraduate degree in Psychology, you might then consider a Masters programme that will develop and enhance the skills you learnt during your Psychology undergraduate. 

Some Masters programmes are designed to be general, such as a Masters in Research Methods in Psychology, and these will look to enhance your skills across a range of different approaches - e.g. building up your qualitative and quantitative skills across various subfields.  Other Masters are designed to be more targeted towards a specific area, such as a Masters in Clinical Psychology, and these will start to really specialise your understanding and knowledge in a particular area, based on what you will have already covered in your undergraduate.

## PGT, PGR, MSc, MRes & PhD

There is always a lot of acronyms and abbreviations involved and these can be very confusing at first. To summarise the main ones that you may come across when thinking about Psychology and related Masters:

* PGT - postgraduate taught
* PGR - postgraduate research
* MRes - Masters by Research
* MSc - Masters of Science
* PhD - Doctorate of Philosophy

As Psychology is considered a science in UK Universities, a lot of the Masters programmes you might be considering will be referred to as an MSc - for example, an MSc in Research Methods of Psychological Science. More often than not, these MSc programmes are considered to be PGT - postgraduate taught - meaning that the programme has a number of modules that you have to complete, along with a dissertation (i.e. a project), just like you did in your undergraduate.

Alternatively, some Masters will be referred to as MRes and these will commonly have no, or very few taught modules, and the whole year will be spent carrying out and writing up a dissertation. As an MRes has often no taught components it is often referred to as PGR - postgraduate by research.

Finally, an MSc and an MRes can be a stepping stone towards starting a PhD (which is also considered part of PGR as it is postgraduate and research-based), but it does not have to.

## What questions to ask?

Hopefully you have an idea now about the different abbreviations and the differences in the types of Masters programmes. Let's assume you were thinking of applying for an MSc in a Psychology related area and you are looking at PGT courses - so ones with a large component of taught courses. What sort of questions would we recommend asking?

**1. What is the divide of the dissertation as well as core and optional modules in terms of credit?**

In the UK, most MSc programmes are made up of 180 credits. How that 180 credits is split across the different modules will vary and this might help you think about how your time will be spent - some modules will be considered **core**, meaning that you have to take those modules, and others will be considered **optional**, meaning that you can choose which ones you take up to a certain limit of credits. Let's look at an example:

* 60 credits for the Dissertation
* 90 credits of Core Modules
* 30 credits of Optional modules

The above programme would mean that there will be a certain number of modules you have to take, let's say 5, and they add up to 90 credits - let's say that 90 credits is made up of four 20 credit modules and one 10 credit module (4x20 + 1x10 = 90). There is then 30 credits from optional modules where you get to choose what you take - let's say three modules of 10 credits each (3x10 = 30) from a choice of six modules. And then you have the dissertation (your project), worth 60 credits, on top of that giving a total of 180 credits (60 + 90 + 30 = 180). 

As you can see, knowing how the course is divided in terms of credits can give you a good idea of what you have to take and what you can choose from. The more optional modules there are, and the more optional credits you can take, the more you can tailor your MSc to your own interests. Conversely, the more core credits there are the less choice you have. Just to add however, some programmes need to have a large component of core credits for accreditation purposes and so it is about thinking about what you want to do with the MSc afterwards as well.

**2. Where can I see all the core and optional modules for the coming year?**

One thing to consider...

**3. Where can I see the requirements for pass, distinction and merit (or the local equivalent)?**

**4. When will I be allocated a supervisor for my Dissertation?**

**5. How much say will I have in choosing my Dissertation supervisor?**

**6. How much say will I have in choosing the topic of my Dissertation?**

**7. In the taught modules, what percentage of assignments are coursework and what percentage of modules are assessed through exams?**

**8. In taught modules, will exams be held online or in-person?**

**9. What sort of support is there in place for people with disabilities or neurodivergent students?**

**10. What sort of community events are there or opportunities to meet and network with other students and staff?**

**11. Is there a Postgraduate Open Day that I could attend to get to know the campus?**

**12. Is it possible to speak to current students or alumni?**

**13. Is there a list of available funding opportunities that I can look at?**

**14. Is there an option to do the programme part-time?**
